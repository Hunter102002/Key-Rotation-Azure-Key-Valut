# Key Rotation with Azure Key Vault

## Objective

The Azure Key Vault Key Rotation Configuration project aimed to configure key rotation for cryptographic keys stored in Azure Key Vault. The goal was to automate the process of key rotation to enhance security by regularly updating encryption keys used in applications and services. This project focused on understanding Azure Key Vault key management, configuring key rotation settings, and ensuring uninterrupted access to encrypted data.

### Skills Learned

- Configuration of key rotation policies for Azure Key Vault cryptographic keys.
- Understanding of key rotation schedules, including frequency and retention periods.
- Integration of Azure Key Vault with applications and services for seamless key rotation.
- Management of key versions and backups to ensure data recovery in case of key compromise.
- Implementation of security best practices for key management and encryption key lifecycle.

### Tools Used

- Azure Key Vault for storing and managing cryptographic keys.
- Azure Portal or Azure CLI for configuring key rotation policies.
- Azure Key Vault SDKs for integrating key management functionalities into applications.
- Azure Monitor for monitoring key rotation events and compliance.
